# tabledata
Multiple Data Source Data Table

This symbol will take multiple data sources and display time series data in tabular form with timestamp columns.  The intended design is to show attribute data (with identical timestamps) for Asset Framework Elements, but works with individual attributes and PI Tag data sources.  The Rebuild Attributes option in the configuration pane rebuilds the data sources when changing assets with the switch asset dropdown.  This feature allows you to utilize the Asset switching when you have loose AF templates with many extended attributes.

You must edit the .js file with name of your PI Web API server!!
